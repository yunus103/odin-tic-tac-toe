# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple browser-based Tic Tac Toe game built with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  
This project was created following **The Odin Project** curriculum.

## Features

- Two-player game (Player X and Player O)
- Keeps track of scores across rounds
- Detects wins and ties
- Start new game, reset game, and play next round
- Responsive and interactive UI with buttons for each cell
- Custom player names input before starting

## How to Play

1. Enter names for Player X and Player O.
2. Click **Start Game**.
3. Click on empty cells to place X or O.
4. The game announces a win or tie.
5. Use **Next Round** to continue, **Reset Game** to clear scores, or **New Game** to reload the page.


## How It Works

- **Player Module** – Tracks names and scores.
- **Game Board Module** – Stores and updates board state.
- **Display Controller** – Updates the DOM, handles user interactions with the board.
